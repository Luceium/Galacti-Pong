# Galacti-Pong
 HTML/CSS/JS + three.js and p5.js project to make a circular pong inspired by a college.
 I will lay out the readme for what I plan to create, so not all features may work.

**Overview**
The familiar pong game but, you rotate around a circle. you can go as far as you would like, including to the opponents side. The only rule is that when it's your turn you hit the ball. You may chose to fight a bot on 3 difficulties, play local multi player, or play multiplayer on line.

**How to Play**
- Player one uses left and right arrows to move left and right on the circle
- Player two uses a and d to move left and right on the circle
- Player one is blue and Player two or the bot is red
- Move to a position where the ball can hit your board and the ball will bounce back
- After each bounce the ball will pick up speed so watch out!!
